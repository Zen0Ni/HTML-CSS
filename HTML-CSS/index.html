                <p class="card-text">Australia Awards in Indonesia aims to support Indonesia's development
                    through the positive contributions of Australian qualified professionals
                    and by strengthening the relationship between Indonesia and Australia.
                    Since 1953, more than 9,000 Indonesians have received short-term and
                    long-term scholarships to study at Australian tertiary institutions. Many
                    of these scholars have later taken up leadership positions and have
                    made a significant difference to Indonesian society.</p>
